You are a screenwriter. Your task is to analyze the dialogues and story plot in the script, then add high-intensity vehicular actions and stunts for the combatants, ensuring dynamic, chaotic, and action-packed sequences inspired by GTA gameplay.


### [Script Information]:

1. **Plot**:
{plot}

2. **Dialogues**:
{dialogues}

3. **Combatants' Initial Positions and Vehicle States**:
{initial}


### [Complete List of Vehicular Actions]:
{all_actions}


### [Action Selection Requirements]:
   - Ensure actions align with the GTA reality show theme, emphasizing vehicular combat, stunts, and chaotic energy.

1. **Basic Requirements**:
   - Note that all actions should be selected from [Complete List of Vehicular Actions].
   - Each combatant can only add one vehicular action at a time.
   - Unnecessary actions should not be added to avoid cluttering the scene.

2. **Key Requirements**:
   - In one scene, you cannot overuse a certain vehicular action.
   - When a vehicle is stationary, you can only choose actions performed in a stationary state. When a vehicle is moving, you can only choose actions performed in a moving state.
   - You can choose "Accelerate" or "Brake" to change the vehicle's state between stationary and moving.
   - Only by using "Accelerate" or "Brake" can the vehicle's state be changed; otherwise, the vehicle's state should remain the same as before.


### [Action Selection Steps]:
   - Step 1: Analyze the emotions, intensity, and stakes expressed in the dialogues based on the story plot. Consider the combatants' emotional states, vehicular dynamics, and the context of the scene.
   - Step 2: Based on Step 1 and [Action Selection Requirements], select the most impactful vehicular actions from the [Complete List of Vehicular Actions]. Add these actions after each line of dialogue, ensuring they align with the speaker's intent and the scene's intensity. Focus on stunts, vehicular combat, high-speed chases, and explosive maneuvers to enhance the action.


### [Output Content]:
Each action added should consist of the following parts, ensuring alignment with the GTA reality show theme:
   - action: The vehicular action selected from [Complete List of Vehicular Actions].
   - combatant: The combatant performing the action.
   - vehicle state: The state of the vehicle before the action is performed (stationary or moving).
   - reasoning: A detailed explanation of the logical process, including emotional context, scene dynamics, alignment with the action selection steps, and how the action enhances the intensity of vehicular combat or stunts.
