You need to write a complete, ensuring the opics are action-packed and align with the GTA reality show theme script based on the given topic "{topic}". This script is for a reality show set in an alternate reality where Grand Theft Auto (GTA) is a competitive sport. Please strictly follow the steps below to perform this task, ensuring the content aligns with the action-packed, vehicular combat, and stunt-focused theme of the GTA reality show.



### Step 1:
Plan three coherent scenes based on the topic, assign a sub-topic to each scene, select corresponding locations and combatants based on the sub-topic, and develop a plot for each scene emphasizing vehicular combat, stunts, and high-intensity action.

This step may require the following information:
#### Main Contestants:
1. **Combatants**: {combatant_characters}

#### Main Locations (Inspired by GTA):
1. **Race Track**: features stunt ramps, obstacles, and high-speed paths.
2. **Desert Arena**: features open terrains, dune ramps, and destructible obstacles.
3. **Urban Streets**: features narrow alleys, sharp turns, and destructible buildings.
4. **VR Simulation Room**: features dynamic virtual environments for vehicular combat.

After this step, the following parts of the script will be completed, ensuring the scenes are action-packed and align with the GTA reality show theme:
"scene_information": {"who": [Selected Combatants], "where": "Selected Location", "what": "The Plot For This Scene"}



### Step 2:
Create specific and vivid dialogues for each scene based on the result from step 1. The dialogues should align with the combatants' profiles and the GTA reality show theme. Include dramatic, action-packed exchanges that emphasize rivalries, alliances, and vehicular combat intensity. The number of conversations in one scene should not be too few.

This step may require the following information:
#### Characters' Profile:
{profiles}

After this step, the following parts of the script will be completed, ensuring the scenes are action-packed and align with the GTA reality show theme:
"dialogues":[{"speaker": "...", "content": "..."}, ...]



### Step 3:
Choose an appropriate position for each combatant in every scene of the script based on the result from step 1. In a scene, each combatant's position must be different, ensuring dynamic interactions and alignment with the GTA reality show format.

This step may require the following information:
#### Optional Positions:
{optional_positions}

After this step, the following parts of the script will be completed, ensuring the scenes are action-packed and align with the GTA reality show theme:
"initial position": [{"character": "...", "position": "Position XX"}, ...]



### Step 4:
Understand the emotions expressed in the dialogues from step 2, and consider the emotional states of the combatants in the conversation. According to your considerations and [Action Selection Requirements], choose the most appropriate vehicular actions from the [Complete List of Actions] and add them after each line of dialogue, including the speaker and some other (not all) combatants' actions. Emphasize stunts, vehicular combat, and chaotic action inspired by GTA gameplay.

Each action added should consist of the following parts:
   - action: The action selected from [Complete List of Actions].
   - combatant: The combatant that performs the action.
   - vehicle state: The state of the vehicle before the action is performed, including stationary or moving.

This step may require the following information:
#### [Complete List of Actions]:
{all_vehicular_actions}


#### [Action Selection Requirements]:

1. **Basic Requirements**:
   - Note that all actions should be selected from [Complete List of Actions].
   - Each character can only add one action at a time.
   - Unnecessary actions should not be added to avoid cluttering the scene.

2. **Key Requirements**:
   - In one scene, you cannot overuse a certain action.
   - When a character is in the standing state, you can only choose the action performed in standing state. When a character is in the sitting state, you can only choose the action performed in sitting state.
   - You can choose "Sit Down" only when the character is at a sittable position.
   - Only by using "Stand Up" or "Sit Down" can the character's state be changed; otherwise, the character's state should remain the same as before.

After this step, the following parts of the script will be completed, ensuring the scenes are action-packed and align with the GTA reality show theme:
"actions": [{"character": "...","state": "....","action": "..."}, ...]



### Step 5:
Focus on the usage conditions of each shot in the [Complete List of Shots], then allocate them to the shot annotation points in the script according to different usage conditions. Ensure the shots capture the intensity of vehicular combat, stunts, explosions, and the chaotic energy of the GTA reality show. Check if the shot annotations meet the [Shot Annotation Requirements]. If not, identify which requirements are not met, then update the shot annotations to meet these requirements.
