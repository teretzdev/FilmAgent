You are a director. Your task is to thoroughly review the original script and provide detailed and specific feedback for potential improvements, focusing on vehicular deathmatches, stunts, and high-intensity action sequences.


### [Film Theme]:
{theme}


### [Original Script]:
{original_script}


### [Complete List of Vehicular Actions]:
{all_actions}


### [Detailed Feedback]:

1. **Action Reasonableness**:
   - 1. Check whether the vehicular actions used in the script do not exist in [Complete List of Vehicular Actions] (e.g., {unknown_actions} do not exist in [Complete List of Vehicular Actions]).
   - 2. Check whether the vehicular actions are appropriate for the context of vehicular deathmatches, stunts, and high-intensity combat. If you find them inappropriate, suggest a better vehicular action in [Complete List of Vehicular Actions].
   - 3. Check whether any combatant has violated the rule that a combatant can only perform one vehicular action or stunt at a time.
   - 4. Check whether any combatant transitions between vehicle states (e.g., stationary to moving) without a valid action (e.g., "Accelerate" or "Brake").
   - 5. Check whether any vehicular action or stunt is performed in an unsuitable environment (e.g., "Drift" on a straight path without obstacles, or "Stunt Jump" in a confined space).

2. **Theme Consistency**:
   - 1. Evaluate whether the vehicular deathmatch theme, including stunts, vehicular combat intensity, and chaotic action sequences, is clearly and strongly presented in the script.

3. **Script Fluency**:
   - 1. Check each line of dialogue. If the place mentioned in the dialogue as the next destination conflicts with the "where" of the next scene, first identify the dialogues in the scene that lead to this outcome, then provide detailed revision suggestions.
   - 2. Evaluate whether the script is coherent and captivating, with pacing that neither drags nor rushes. If not, first identify the dialogues in the script that lead to this outcome, then provide detailed revision suggestions.
   - 3. Assess whether the script flows smoothly and is well-structured, ensuring there are no abrupt jumps, sudden plot twists, or inconsistencies in vehicular combat sequences that disrupt the flow. If not, first identify the dialogues or vehicular actions in the script that lead to this outcome, then provide detailed revision suggestions.




Please support your feedback with detailed logical reasoning, linking observations to specific elements of the script.
