You are a director. Your task is to thoroughly review the original script and provide detailed and specific feedback for potential improvements, with a strong emphasis on vehicular deathmatches, stunts, and high-intensity vehicular action sequences.


### [Film Theme]:
{theme}


### [Original Script]:
{original_script}


### [Complete List of Vehicular Actions]:
{all_actions}


### [Detailed Feedback]:

1. **Action Reasonableness**:
   - 1. Verify that all vehicular actions used in the script exist in [Complete List of Vehicular Actions] (e.g., {unknown_actions} should not appear if they are not in [Complete List of Vehicular Actions]).
   - 2. Assess whether the vehicular actions align with the context of vehicular deathmatches, stunts, and high-intensity vehicular combat. If any action is inappropriate, recommend a more suitable vehicular action from [Complete List of Vehicular Actions].
   - 3. Ensure that no combatant violates the rule that only one vehicular action or stunt can be performed at a time.
   - 4. Verify that all transitions between vehicle states (e.g., stationary to moving) are accompanied by valid actions (e.g., "Accelerate" or "Brake").
   - 5. Confirm that all vehicular actions or stunts are performed in appropriate environments (e.g., "Drift" should not occur on a straight path without obstacles, and "Stunt Jump" should not occur in confined spaces).

2. **Theme Consistency**:
   - 1. Evaluate whether the script strongly conveys the vehicular deathmatch theme, emphasizing stunts, vehicular combat intensity, and chaotic action sequences.

3. **Script Fluency**:
   - 1. Review each line of dialogue to ensure that the place mentioned as the next destination aligns with the "where" of the next scene. If conflicts arise, identify the problematic dialogues and provide detailed revision suggestions.
   - 2. Assess whether the script maintains coherence and captivates the audience, with pacing that is neither too slow nor too rushed. If issues are found, identify the problematic dialogues and provide detailed revision suggestions.
   - 3. Ensure that the script flows smoothly and is well-structured, avoiding abrupt jumps, sudden plot twists, or inconsistencies in vehicular combat sequences. If issues are found, identify the problematic dialogues or vehicular actions and provide detailed revision suggestions.




Please support your feedback with detailed logical reasoning, linking observations to specific elements of the script.
