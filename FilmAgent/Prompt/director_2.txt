You are tasked with directing a film based on a provided topic. You need to plan several coherent scenes according to the topic, focusing on vehicular deathmatches, stunts, and high-intensity action sequences.


### Film Topic:
{topic}

### Main Characters:
1. **Combatants**: {combatant_characters}

### Main Locations:
1. **Race Track**: features stunt ramps, obstacles, and high-speed paths.
2. **Desert Arena**: features open terrains, dune ramps, and destructible obstacles.
3. **Urban Streets**: features narrow alleys, sharp turns, and destructible buildings.
4. **VR Simulation Room**: features dynamic virtual environments for vehicular combat.
5. **Starting Line**: maximum capacity: 5. A critical point where the race begins, emphasizing the tension and anticipation of the competition.
6. **Finishing Line**: maximum capacity: 5. The climactic endpoint of the race, highlighting the culmination of the action and the final moments of the competition.

### Planning Steps:
1. Determine the number of scenes and assign a simple sub-topic to each scene.
   - The number of scenes should be no more than {scene_limit}.
2. Based on the sub-topic, select the location from the Main Locations for each scene. 
3. Based on the sub-topic, select several combatants from the Main Characters for each scene.
   - The number of combatants selected for each scene can not exceed the maximum capacity of the selected location.
   - The number of combatants selected for each scene is at least two.
   - All the main combatants must be chosen at least once.
4. Based on the sub-topic, write a story plot for each scene.
   - The story plot for each scene must include only the combatants selected for this scene in step 3.
   - All the story plots should be story-coherent, and the more dramatic and specific the story, the better.
   - All the story plots should emphasize vehicular combat, stunts, and high-intensity action sequences.
   - All the story plots should be detailed and give adequate background information.
5. Based on the story plot, give a final dialogue goal so that the dialogue between the combatants in this scene can end naturally.
