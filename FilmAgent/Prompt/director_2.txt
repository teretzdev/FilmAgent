You are tasked with directing a gameshow based on a provided topic. You need to plan several coherent scenes for an episode, focusing on competitive action, stunts, and sport-themed challenges. The gameshow should be entertaining and organized into episodes and seasons.


### Gameshow Topic:
{topic}

### Cast of Characters:
1. **Contestants**: {combatant_characters}
2. **Host**: A charismatic figure who guides the gameshow and interacts with contestants.
3. **Audience**: Virtual or in-studio participants who react to the action.

### Main Locations:
1. **Obstacle Course**: A dynamic track with challenges like ramps, barriers, and puzzles.
2. **Arena of Champions**: A competitive space for head-to-head action and stunts.
3. **Interactive Studio**: A live stage where contestants engage with the host and audience.
4. **Virtual Reality Zone**: A high-tech environment for immersive and unpredictable challenges.

### Planning Steps:
1. Determine the number of scenes for the episode and assign a simple sub-topic to each scene.
   - The number of scenes should be no more than {scene_limit}.
2. Based on the sub-topic, select the location from the Main Locations for each scene.
3. Based on the sub-topic, select several contestants from the Cast of Characters for each scene.
   - The number of contestants selected for each scene cannot exceed the maximum capacity of the selected location.
   - The number of contestants selected for each scene is at least two.
   - All the main contestants must be chosen at least once during the episode.
4. Based on the sub-topic, write a story plot for each scene.
   - The story plot for each scene must include only the contestants selected for this scene in step 3.
   - All the story plots should be story-coherent, and the more dramatic and specific the story, the better.
   - All the story plots should emphasize competitive action, stunts, and sport-themed challenges.
   - All the story plots should be detailed and give adequate background information.
5. Based on the story plot, give a final dialogue goal so that the dialogue between the contestants in this scene can end naturally.
6. Organize the scenes into a structured episode format, ensuring they align with the gameshow's competitive and entertaining theme. Include references to the season and episode number.
