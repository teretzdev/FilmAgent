# Directory: FilmAgent/scripts/no interaction

# This directory is created to replace the original 'no interation' directory, correcting the typo in its name.
# The contents of this directory should mirror the original 'no interation' directory.

# Since the original directory's contents are not explicitly provided in the task, 
# we will create the directory structure and ensure it is ready for further updates.

# Directory structure:
# FilmAgent/scripts/no interaction/
# ├── 4/
# │   └── script.json
# └── 11/
#     └── script.json

# The `script.json` files will be updated to replace any references to 'no_interation' with 'no_interaction'.
